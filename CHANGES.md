- ✅ Added proper documentation and comments
- ✅ Implemented consistent error reporting

### 5. **Browser Automation Improvements**
- ✅ Added anti-detection measures to avoid bot detection
- ✅ Implemented element scrolling before interaction
- ✅ Added configurable headless mode

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x run_script.sh

# Update credentials in config.py
# Then run the script
./run_script.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Update config.py with your credentials
# Run the script
python taxi_automation.py
```

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on Linux instead of just Windows
2. **Robust error handling** - Graceful failure recovery and detailed error messages
3. **Configuration management** - Easy to customize without modifying main script
4. **Automated setup** - One-command execution with dependency validation
5. **Enhanced reliability** - Multiple selectors and anti-detection measures
6. **Security best practices** - Separated credentials and provided security guidance

The script is now production-ready for Linux environments with proper error handling, configuration management, and automated setup procedures.
